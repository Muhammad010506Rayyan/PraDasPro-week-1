1. If in for loop, the initialization i = 1 is changed to i = 0, what is the result? How can It be like that?
   answer: if i is 0, and then we set the N was 1 for example, then there will be 2 star for the output because we count it from 0
2. If in for loop, condition i <= N is changed to i > N, what is the result? How can It be like that?
   answer: if we set the N more higher than i which was 1, then there will be no output
3. If in for loop, the condition for step i++ is changed to i-- what is the result? How can it be like that?
   asnwer: it will make infinite loop
