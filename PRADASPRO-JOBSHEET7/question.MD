1.There are 3 main components in FOR loop. Based on experiment 1 above, identify and
explain these 3 components!
answer:
• initialization : declaration and initialization counter variable (repetitioncontrol variable)
example: int i = 1
• condition : limit or condition for the loop to continue executing
example: i<=50>
• update : changes the value of the counter variable at each loop
(increment or decrement)
example:i++

2.Explain how the following code works!
answer: for the condition i=1 get modulus by multiple variable is equal 0, it means when we got the multiple number from variable multiple, we add counter variable with 1 so it means we found 1 multiple value from our input.

3.Modify the existing code by adding a new variable to calculate the average of all the
specified multiples!
4.Create a new Java program file named WhileMultiplesNoAbsen.java.
